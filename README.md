# Bayes_Theory_Game
Mobile App that shows thought experiment of bayes theory as a game, inspiration taken from Hannah Frys Hello World

idea is an ( invisiable ) ball is dopeed and the player requests addtional balls to be droped they can see,
this represents the reference to the original ball, as all visable balls are locked. the player can move the locked balls about until they think they know where the actual ball is,
score based on number of extra balls.
